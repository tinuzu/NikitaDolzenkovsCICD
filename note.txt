To fix the issue "The deployment failed because a specified file already exists at this location: /var/www/html/index.html"
you can add additional condition to allow file override.

In appspec.yml file after line 5 add following line:

file_exists_behavior: OVERWRITE

Take into account that yml files are very sensitive on all spaces. Each space before the line matters. 
Above line starts at the first symbol.
